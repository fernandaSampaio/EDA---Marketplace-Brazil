# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Brazil e-commerce. 

## Context
The purpose of this analysis is to present an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) of Olist Store, a Brazilian marketplace. The dataset contains detailed information on orders placed between 2016 and 2018, covering various aspects such as order status, pricing, payment methods, shipping performance, and geolocation data, including latitude and longitude.

This is real business data provided by Olist, with some sensitive information anonymized. I hope this notebook serves as a useful resource, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions you may have.
